# embryoJS
JS mini library to replace jQuery with minimal lines of code. Inspired by Zepto.js, but quite smaller in scope and size. 

## Why
I was tired of jQuery parsing times. Don't misunderstand me, jQuery is nice, but too overbloated due to legacy browsers' support. EmbryoJS supports only modern browsers, on purpose, to make it tiny and blazing fast. 

## Disclaimer
EmbryoJS does not match all of jQuery/Zepto API, just the most used methods (OK, the ones that I use the most).
